# semialign-merge

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/qfpl/semialign-diff.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/qfpl/semialign-diff)

Functors that are both `Semialign` and `Witherable` support a
filtering merge operation. This package introduces new classes that
witness this fact, and provide support for more efficient merging
operations that take advantage of the structures being merged over.
