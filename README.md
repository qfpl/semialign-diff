# semialign-diff

If a type is both `Filterable` (from
[`filterable`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/witherable)) and
`Semialign` (from
[`semialign`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/semialign)), then
you can diff values of that type. This is most useful with map-like
types (`Map`, `HashMap`, `IntMap`).
